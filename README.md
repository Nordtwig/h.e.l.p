A first-person thriller store management game, set in a dystopian future. Inspired by games such as Papers Please and Janoply, and settings such as George Orwell's 1984 and Starship Troopers. 

Gameplay
- Management
	- Manage the supplies on your shelves. You have free reign of how and where to store stuff, but you will be reprimanded for leaving things on the floor. 
	- Sleep - Player needs to sleep through the night, or they'll be more and more tired and eventually fall asleep during the day and be reprimanded. Player will often be interrupted during sleep by delivery truck or other events. 
	- Eat - The player needs to eat or they'll starve. The only food allowed is the nutrient bars by the bedside, but there's nothing physically stopping the player from eating supplies from the shelves. This will get them reprimanded. 
- Libation System
	- Throughout the day (and some times during the night, spookily), there will be a customer on the outside. This is represented by a blurting sound from the alarm, and the lightbulb switching from green to red. The player can then pull the coupon tray to retrieve the coupons and the grocery list. If nothing's in there, or incorrect thing (you will have the opportunity to control coupons like in Papers Please), you can press the prompt to the left of the tray and push it back out. This will sound a tinny robotic voice stating "Please provide valid coupons in tray". If coupons are correct, you can feed them into a machine.
	- Next, rotate the basket system to reveal the basket on your side. If there's something suspicious inside, immediately rotate it back out and call the peacekeepers if needed. 
	- With the grocery list in hand and basket revealed, you can start placing the correct items within the basket. Move around the shelves with a timely fashion. 
	- When done, rotate the basket back out. If exchange accepted, bulb will switch and alarm bleep again.
